RH_AMP:
 -Y -> careful noise shaping, only max. distorted band at once

KLEMM_04:
 - correctly calculated FIR coefficients
 - sample_t instead of FLOAT for FIR coefficients
 
KLEMM_05:
 only write brhist lines if neccessary

KLEMM_06:
 fseek instead of fread (if available)

KLEMM_07 (always on):
 - new timestatus only using lametime.c functions
 - more simple code

KLEMM_14: (missing)
 some optimizations and code simplifications (unrolled code)

KLEMM_36:
 portability fixes in the IO code

KLEMM_42:
 new bandwith calculation

KLEMM_43:
 cleaned up tables in tables.c

KLEMM_44: (missing)
 enable code in pcm.c (new API)


USE_GOGO_SUBBAND:
 ?

NOTABLES (allways off!):
 ?

NEWS3:
 ?

NORES_TEST (allways on):
 - don't let the 2nd granule use bits saved by the 1st granule
 - useful for testing only

NEW_DRAIN (theres a define above: NEW_DRAINXX):
 ?
 comment:
   mdb_bytes = x/8; m ?= n ?= o ?= 8* mdb_bytes; p ?= mdb_bytes
   ( ? == [+-] )
   - optimization should handle this, but it looks ugly
   - do we lose precision here?

LAME_STD_PRINT:
 more verbose output?

PRECOMPUTE (always on, multiple defines):
 precomputes blackman window?

TAKEHIRO_IEEE754_HACK (conditionally on (x86)):
 speed optimization?
 (should move into configure.in)

USE_GNUC_ASM:
 speed optimization
 (should move into configure.in)

MAXQUANTERROR:
 ?

... alot of #if 0 / #if 1 not evaluated ...
