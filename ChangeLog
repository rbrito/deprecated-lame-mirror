2001-03-10 19:15  markt

	* libmp3lame/encoder.c:

	a little more tuning of tot_energy for ATH adjust
	
2001-03-10 19:06  markt

	* libmp3lame/encoder.c:

	modified ATH adjustment code to use tot_ener returned by psy model
	and not the maximum of the PCM sample values.
	
	We need to replace this with JD's formula.   We need to decide
	if this is really worth while.  My preference is to take the
	most conservative ATH possible, but this seems to produce too
	high bitrates for VBR modes. (this may no longer be true
	not that masings are computed in all scalefactor bands)
	
2001-03-10 18:33  markt

	* frontend/get_audio.c:

	added 127 also, on recommendation of JD, to 8bit -> 16bit
	conversion routine
	
2001-03-10 18:29  markt

	* frontend/get_audio.c:

	fix from "J.D." <jodaman@cegt201.bradley.edu> for
	8 bit input support.
	
2001-03-09 17:56  markt

	* test/lametest.py:

	'os.pathsep' changed to 'os.sep'
	
	For example, on unix:
	
	os.pathsep = ":"  - the character that seperaters search paths in
	                    the PATH environment variable
	
	os.sep = "/"      - the charcter that seperates directories
	
2001-03-07 12:32  aleidinger

	* test/lametest.py:

	- use OS independent path seperator
	
2001-03-07 12:31  aleidinger

	* DEFINES:

	- NOTABELS is now the default
	
2001-03-05 20:29  markt

	* libmp3lame/: lame.c, psymodel.c, quantize_pvt.c:

	code (disabled) to use minimum value when going from partition
	bands to scalefactor bands (instead of average value)
	
2001-03-05 18:21  markt

	* testcase.mp3, libmp3lame/psymodel.c, libmp3lame/quantize_pvt.c:

	Noise calculation:  had to switch calculation of tot_noise and
	over_noise back to being done in db units.  Multiply (to save
	the 22 log10() function calls) was overflowing.
	
	updated testcases to reflect changes
	
2001-03-05 01:44  markt

	* testcase.mp3:

	updated testcase.mp3 for NOTABLES code
	
2001-03-05 01:26  markt

	* libmp3lame/psymodel.c:

	NOTABLES enabled by default.
	
	Psycho acoustics computed in *all* scalefactor bands.
	
	cvs tag before this change:  before_notables
	cvs tag after this change:   notables
	
2001-03-05 01:25  markt

	* libmp3lame/psymodel.c:

	The last commit before NOTABLES becomes the default.
	tagged with "before.notables"
	
2001-03-04 20:03  markt

	* libmp3lame/: encoder.c, psymodel.c, psymodel.h, util.h:

	More prep work for enabling NOTABLES.
	Will now compute masking for all scalefactor bands
	
2001-03-04 15:30  markt

	* testcase.mp3, libmp3lame/psymodel.c, libmp3lame/util.c:

	Finished proper normalization of spreading function.
	
	updated testcases
	
2001-03-04 06:56  markt

	* libmp3lame/psymodel.c:

	more tweaking of s3 normalization
	
2001-03-04 06:48  markt

	* libmp3lame/psymodel.c:

	spreading function moved into seperate routine, s3_func().
	s3 normalized so that:
	
	         +inf
	           /
	           |  s3 [ bark ]  d(bark)   =  1
	           /
	         -inf
	
	which resulted in dividing the result by 0.66.
	
	This is the first step in fixing the long outstanding bug
	mentioned by Takehiro:  s3[i][j] is normalized improperly for
	values of i near the partition band boundaries.  For these values,
	the computed 'norm' is much too small since a lot of the data is
	missing, resulting in artificially increasing the spreading function
	(and thus the masking)
	
	--nspsytune: s3_l function is used with a normalization of .5
	(instead of computing the norm).  So I changed this to a .5*.66
	to compensate for the above change.
	
	Next step:
	
	1.
	s3[i][j] will be multiplied by the width (in barks) of the
	j'th partition band (about .35).  Once this is done, we will not need to
	compute and divide by 'norm' later.
	
	2.
	Make NOTABLES the default
	
	3.
	compute psymodel all the way up to 22khz.
	
2001-03-04 05:51  markt

	* API, libmp3lame/lame.c, libmp3lame/util.c, libmp3lame/util.h:

	added prototypes to lame.c  (but functions not yet written)
	
2001-03-04 05:13  markt

	* include/lame.h:

	finished last of the prototypes
	
2001-03-04 05:02  markt

	* frontend/get_audio.c:

	changed to:
	
	        gfp->num_samples = data_length / (channels * ((bits_per_sample+7) / 8));
	
	thanks J.D.!
	
2001-03-04 00:20  markt

	* include/lame.h, libmp3lame/lame.c:

	added:
	lame_encode_buffer_sample_t, which is called by the following functions
	in the API:
	
	lame_encode_buffer                 (original, short int interface)
	lame_encode_buffer_float
	lame_encode_buffer_long
	
2001-03-02 22:39  markt

	* frontend/get_audio.c, test/lametest.py:

	get_audio.c: fixed num_samples computation for case when
	bits_per_sample < 8.  (althouth this case is already trapped for
	earlier)
	
	lametest.py:  slight change to reference mp3 filename generation
	so lametest.py can be run from another directory.
	
2001-03-02 18:28  markt

	* Makefile.am, testcase.mp3, doc/html/Makefile.in,
	doc/man/Makefile.in, frontend/get_audio.c,
	libmp3lame/i386/Makefile.in:

	error message about non-PCM wave files from
	"J.D." <jodaman@cegt201.bradley.edu>
	
	Added "make testupdate" to Makefile.am, which updates
	the test file in the CVS repository
	
2001-02-27 11:54  robert

	* include/lame.h, libmp3lame/lame.c:

2001-02-27 11:38  aleidinger

	* configure, Makefile.in, frontend/Makefile.in, misc/Makefile.in:

	regen
	
2001-02-27 11:37  aleidinger

2001-02-27 11:36  aleidinger

	* Makefile.am:

	remove testcase.new.mp3 on error
	
2001-02-27 11:36  aleidinger

	* configure.in:

	display version of gcc
	
2001-02-27 11:35  aleidinger

	* include/lame.h:

	fix typo in comment
	
2001-02-27 11:33  aleidinger

	* libmp3lame/util.c:

	include machine/floatingpoint.h on FreeBSD
	
2001-02-27 09:59  robert

	* libmp3lame/: VbrTag.c, bitstream.c, lame.c, quantize_pvt.h,
	takehiro.c, util.c, util.h:

	VbrTag.c   fixed gfp/gfc typo
	lame.c     made data flow analysis happier: there was a possible path to use channels before definition. Even though it would be an error following this path, but the compiler doesn't know it
	util.hc    message functions are not intended to change gfc?!?
	takehiro.c fixed a warning
	bitstream.c fixed a warning
	
2001-02-27 06:14  markt

	* frontend/gtkanal.c, include/lame.h, libmp3lame/VbrTag.c,
	libmp3lame/bitstream.c, libmp3lame/lame.c, libmp3lame/psymodel.c,
	libmp3lame/quantize.c, libmp3lame/quantize_pvt.h,
	libmp3lame/takehiro.c, libmp3lame/util.c, libmp3lame/util.h,
	libmp3lame/vbrquantize.c:

	
	Implmented Frank's excellent idea about error messages:
	
	gfc->errorf, gfc->msgf and gfc->debugf are all FILE *.
	default is stderr.  If you want to disable all internal library
	messages, set these to NULL with lame_set_errorf(), lame_set_msgf() etc...
	
	For a GUI, you can set these to regular files, and then read
	the files and display the messages in an pop up window.
	
	Maybe the default should be NULL?
	
2001-02-27 05:17  markt

	* include/lame.h:

	plugging away at a few more prototypes
	
2001-02-26 22:45  robert

	* frontend/parse.c, libmp3lame/util.c:

	little change to Roel's --r3mix setting, on request by Roel
	
2001-02-26 19:08  markt

	* libmp3lame/VbrTag.c:

	non RH_SEEKTABLE code removed from VbrTag.c
	
2001-02-26 18:57  markt

	* frontend/lametime.c:

	removed to //include lines
	
2001-02-26 18:52  markt

	* frontend/: get_audio.c, lametime.c:

	
	incomprehensible gobbledygook replaced by call to standard
	'stat' function for file size.
	
2001-02-26 08:06  markt

	* include/lame.h:

	more prototypes added to lame.h
	
2001-02-26 07:38  markt

	* USAGE, frontend/parse.c, libmp3lame/lame.c:

	useTemporal turned on by default

2001-02-26 07:26  markt

	* include/lame.h:

	added more of the lame_get/lame_set prototypes to lame.h
	
	also added this:
	
	// I give up. Klemm has worn me down on this one...
	typedef lame_global_flags lame_t;
	
2001-02-26 06:34  markt

	* misc/Lame.vbs:

	lame.vbs changes submitted by "Paul Reedy" <ka5pmv@webzone.net>
	
2001-02-25 22:47  markt

	* libmp3lame/vorbis_interface.c:

	removed a klemm_42 from vorbis_interface.c
	
2001-02-25 22:47  markt

	* INSTALL, libmp3lame/lame.c, libmp3lame/vorbis_interface.c:

	klemm_42 enabled by default.
	
	This code uses a different formula to choose the lowpass
	filter.  It takes into account stereo vs. jstereo
	(jstereo gets 25% more bandwidth).  This has the effect
	of stereo 128kbps using a 14khz lowpass filter, which some
	people may not like.
	
2001-02-25 22:02  markt

	* libmp3lame/lame.c, test/CBRABR.op:

	made allow_diff_short the default if mode=stereo and
	allow_diff_short has not been set to 0 or 1 by the calling
	program.
	
	addes these notes to lame_init_params() :
	 *
	 * We first have some complex code to determine bitrate,
	 * output samplerate and mode.  It is complicated by the fact
	 * that we allow the user to set some or all of these parameters,
	 * and need to determine best possible values for the rest of them:
	 *
	 *   set some CPU related flags
	 *   check if we are mono->mono, stereo->mono or stereo->stereo
	 *   compute bitrate and output samplerate:
	 *          user may have set compression ratio
	 *          user may have set a bitrate
	 *          user may have set a output samplerate
	 *   set some options which depend on output samplerate
	 *   compute the actual compression ratio
	 *   set mode based on compression ratio
	 *
	 *  The remaining code is much simpler - it just sets options
	 *  based on the mode & compression ratio:
	 *
	 *   set allow_diff_short based on mode
	 *   select lowpass filter based on compression ratio & mode
	 *   set the bitrate index, and min/max bitrates for VBR modes
	 *   disable VBR tag if it is not appropriate
	 *   initialize the bitstream
	 *   initialize scalefac_band data
	 *   set sideinfo_len (based on channels, CRC, out_samplerate)
	 *   write an id3v2 tag into the bitstream
	 *   write VBR tag into the bitstream
	 *   set mpeg1/2 flag
	 *   estimate the number of frames (based on a lot of data)
	 *
	 *   now we set more flags:
	 *   nspsytune:
	 *      see code
	 *   VBR modes
	 *      see code
	 *   CBR/ABR
	 *      see code
	
2001-02-25 21:28  markt

	* frontend/parse.c:

	removed VBR warning
	
2001-02-25 20:24  markt

	* libmp3lame/psymodel.c:

	edited a few comments in psymodel.c
	
2001-02-25 20:17  markt

	* libmp3lame/encoder.c, libmp3lame/psymodel.c,
	libmp3lame/psymodel.h, libmp3lame/util.h, test/nores.op:

	Started some re-originization of psymodel.c
	created:
	
	psymodel_init() function, called by both psymodel and psymodel_ns.
	
	I was carefull to make sure no binary changes were introduced
	with --nspsytune.
	
	Modified both psymodel and psymodel_ns to return the
	energy in each channel.  I'm going to request that the
	ATH level adjust be based on the energy comptuted by the
	psymodel, rather than computing a magnitude in encoder.c
	
2001-02-25 17:37  markt

	* Dll/BladeMP3EncDLL.c, frontend/parse.c, include/lame.h,
	libmp3lame/lame.c, libmp3lame/util.c, libmp3lame/util.h:

	removed mode_fixed variable.  If calling program selects a mode
	(mono, stereo, jstereo) then that mode is used, otherwise
	lame picks best mode to use.
	
2001-02-25 01:58  markt

	* include/lame.h:

	started adding more prototypes into lame.h:
	
	int lame_set_variable_name(lame_global_flags *, int)
	int lame_get_variable_name(lame_global_flags *)
	
	_get will return the value (instead of an error code)
	as suggested.
	
	_set will return an error code.  But right now, the way lame
	works there is no error checking until lame_init_params() is
	called.  This is because, for example, bitrate=135
	is not an error if free_format=1, but it is an error
	for CBR.  So many errors cannot be detected until all options
	are set.
	
2001-02-24 19:35  markt

	* include/lame.h, libmp3lame/util.h:

	commented out a uint_64_t field in util.h to get lame to
	compile.  Do we really need these types of variables?
	
	removed some stuff from lame.h.  Note that many decisions have
	already been made about the library interface, so if you are
	planning on changing this, you need to check with me
	(mark taylor) first.  In particular,
	there is going to be no file I/O, and all data is in
	machine order. (no endian stuff in the library).
	
2001-02-24 13:55  robert

	* Makefile.unix, configMS.h:

	get Makefile.unix working again (tested for Linux, not for OS/2 etc.)

	take sfb21 into consideration for median search
	
2001-02-21 17:06  robert

	* libmp3lame/util.c:

	index transformation in select_kth_int()
	
2001-02-21 14:59  aleidinger

	* libmp3lame/takehiro.c:

	  - CPU_features is now a struct
	
2001-02-20 18:19  aleidinger

	    bolean values (Frank)
	  - introduce some KLEMM_44 protected code
	
2001-02-20 18:18  aleidinger

2001-02-20 18:17  aleidinger

	* libmp3lame/version.c:

	  - doxygen parseable documentation
	  - better lclint flags
	  - enable get_lame_version_numerical()
	
2001-02-20 18:17  aleidinger

	* include/lame.h:

	  - delete prototype of already removed get_lame_about()
	  - add get_lame_version_numerical() and lame_version_t
	    (now dshow didn't needs to include version.h to get the numerical
	     version of lame (dshow not changed, I let pgubanov do this))
	  - introduce some KLEMM_44 protected code  (Frank)
	  - rework formatting and documentation to be more (IMO much more) readable
	    (no lines longer than 80 chars, consistent formatting, looks alot cleaner)
	
2001-02-20 10:41  aleidinger

	* DEFINES:

	Remove KLEMM_04, there was a previous commit which handled it, see
	ChangeLog.

	* DEFINES, frontend/brhist.c, frontend/get_audio.c,
	frontend/timestatus.c:

	KLEMM 5,6,7 made the default & removed
	
2001-02-20 00:40  markt

	* libmp3lame/lame.c:

	simplified lame_encoder_buffer_interleaved: it now always calls
	lame_encoder_buffer()
	
2001-02-20 00:30  markt

	* libmp3lame/: encoder.c, lame.c, util.c, util.h:

	fix for --scale problem?
	
	made a new routine:  fill_buffer()
	
	This is the generic routine used to copy data from the input buffer
	into lame's internal buffer, 'mfbuf[]'.
	
	It also calls the resample code if necessary, and the user selected
	rescaling code if necessary.
	
2001-02-20 00:26  markt

	* frontend/parse.c:

	added comment to vbr warning message
	
2001-02-20 00:24  markt

	* frontend/parse.c:

	re-added the warning about VBR modes. It seems to have been deleted
	at some point.
	
	This is because this website:
	
	http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2001/1/25/164540/759
	
	is comparing Vorbis with lame -V4.
	
	While many people like the high bitrate VBR modes,
	lame -V4 is *often* of lower quality than CBR.
	
2001-02-19 18:29  aleidinger

	* test/VBR.op:

	 - remove "--silent", lametest.py now handles this
	
	 Aproved by: robert
	
2001-02-19 18:28  aleidinger

	* test/lametest.py:

	 - allow relative paths in a more portable manner
	 - should be more OS independand now
	 - more file checks (readable/executable)
	 - internally adds new option "--quiet" to the options
	
	 This works on my system, it also should work on systems where the
	 previous version worked. It's not as portable as it could be,
	 search for XXX in the source.
	
2001-02-18 21:18  robert

	* frontend/main.c, frontend/parse.c, libmp3lame/lame.c,
	libmp3lame/version.h, test/VBR.op:

	new options --silent and --quiet to be really quiet
	new option --verbose (default) to turn -S/--silent off again
	--vbr-mtrh and --vbr-new use now ATH type 2
	for VBR modes it is allowed to use different block types in stereo mode (not yet joint stereo)
	bumped version to 3.88 alpha 10
	
2001-02-18 12:11  aleidinger

	* dshow/: Makefile.am, Makefile.in:

	Add recently added files to the makefile.
	
2001-02-17 15:45  pgubanov

	* dshow/Encoder.cpp:

	gfp is sometimes zero in CEncoder::Encode() - why???
	
2001-02-17 14:30  aleidinger

	* libmp3lame/: pcm.c, pcm.h:

	New code from Frank, some needed parts in different files aren't commited
	yet, they produce huge differences with lametest.py even if KLEMM_44 isn't
	defined. -> KLEMM_44 (new API + resampling) isn't usable yet
	
2001-02-17 14:27  aleidinger

	* test/lametest.py:

	 - use "/usr/bin/env python" instead of "/usr/bin/python" in shebang line
	   (portability)
	 - use "-l" instead of "--lines" for wc
	   (portability, has to run on every IEEE 1003.2 ("POSIX.2") compliant
	   system)
	 - bugfix, check for lame2 instead for lame1 in the lame2 part
	   (Note: the entire test didn't work for me if I use e.g.
	    ./lametest.py XXX.op ../../testcases/XXX ../../build.org/frontend/lame ...)
	
2001-02-17 14:17  pgubanov

	* dshow/: aboutprp.cpp, aboutprp.h:

	Elecard copyrigth added (executives need it for some reason)
	
2001-02-17 13:58  pgubanov

	* dshow/: Mpegac.cpp, Property.rc, UIDS.H, dshow.dsp, dshow.dsw,
	elogo.ico, resource.h:

	Some stability improvements + Elecard copyrigth added (executives need it for some reason)
	
2001-02-16 17:23  markt

	added basic.html to cvs
	
2001-02-16 10:35  pgubanov

	* dshow/dshow.dsp:

	STDC_HEADERS defined in project settings
	
2001-02-16 10:33  pgubanov

	* libmp3lame/lame.c:

	mono handling in encode_buffer_interleaved caused access violation - fixed
	
2001-02-14 22:22  aleidinger

2001-02-14 20:50  robert

	* frontend/parse.c:

	added -V1 to Roel's --remix preset, I assume it was missing by accident

	* Makefile.am.global, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure,
	configure.in, Dll/Makefile.in, debian/Makefile.in, doc/Makefile.in,

2001-02-13 16:58  robert

	* frontend/parse.c, include/lame.h, libmp3lame/encoder.c,
	libmp3lame/lame.c, libmp3lame/psymodel.c,
	libmp3lame/quantize_pvt.c, libmp3lame/util.c, libmp3lame/util.h:

	first of all: this patch shows no difference in the CBR/ABR test
	
	- made athtype 3 default for VBR modes, 1 still default for CBR/ABR modes
	- made athadjust default for VBR modes, CBR/ABR modes don't need it
	- removed --athadjust switch, was only temporally solution

2001-02-12 18:24  markt

	* doc/html/: contributors.html, history.html, index.html,

	update to the VBR python options file
	
2001-02-07 15:51  robert

	* libmp3lame/: encoder.c, vbrquantize.c:

	all patches --vbr-mtrh related
	
	encoder.c:
	- made a variant of Gaby's auto ATH adjust the default
	
	vbrquantize.c:
	- some small code moves
	- added some safety margin to the global gain
	
2001-02-06 21:43  robert

	* libmp3lame/: psymodel.c, vbrquantize.c:

	we should not try to hard to get high freqs thru'
	so I will let --vbr-mtrh as is. It seems to give
	reasonable file sizes again, even with Frank's ATH.
	
2001-02-05 10:18  robert

	* frontend/parse.c, include/lame.h, libmp3lame/encoder.c,
	libmp3lame/quantize_pvt.c:

	re-check-in of Gaby's ATH auto adjustment code.
	You need to specify --athadjust to get this
	SUBSTANTIALLY QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
	
	quote:
	 "Also, we already have gfc->ath_lower (specified in db).
	 No reason to add another variable which does the same thing,
	 and does not even use the same units."
	
	That is not true, there is actually no gfc->ath_lower in dB.
	We have a gfp->ATHlower in dB. But this is of a totally
	different meaning.
	  gfp->ATHlower will lower the ATH for the whole file by a fixed
	  amount of x dB.
	  gfc->ath_auto_adjust will lower the ATH on a frame by frame basis
	  depending on the peak volume.
	
2001-02-05 04:58  markt

	* frontend/parse.c:

	Added warning about using VBR modes.
	This is because this website:
	
	http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2001/1/25/164540/759
	
	is comparing Vorbis with lame -V4.
	
	While many people like the high bitrate VBR modes,
	lame -V4 is *often* of lower quality than CBR.
	
2001-02-05 02:36  shibatch

2001-02-05 02:24  markt

	* test/: CBRABR.op, VBR.op, lametest.py, nores.op:

	Adding a python script used for testing, along with
	some sample options files.
	
2001-02-05 02:23  markt

	* HACKING, libmp3lame/encoder.c, libmp3lame/quantize_pvt.c:

	reverted encoder.c and quantize_pvt.c back to 13:00 3 Feb 2001.
	These modifications broke my test cases.  Any such changes need
	aproval first.
	
	Also, we already have gfc->ath_lower (specified in db).
	No reason to add another variable which does the same thing,
	and does not even use the same units.
	
2001-02-05 00:34  cisc

	* frontend/amiga_mpega.c:

	MPG_MD_LR_LR define was moved, set mode_ext to 0 instead (since we don't get that info anyway).
	
2001-02-04 23:56  robert

	* frontend/parse.c, libmp3lame/lame.c, libmp3lame/vbrquantize.c:

	parse.c: small change in default behaviour for --vbr-mtrh
	lame.c: it makes no sense for a sfb21 extra at sample frequencies below 44.1 kHz
	vbrquantize.c: oops, last commit was a merger from a wrong branch of mine
	
2001-02-04 23:28  shibatch

	- config*/Makefile*/ac*:
	   * tests for *int*_t
	   * test for 80 bit floats (for speed optimizations)
	   * add pcm.* to the makefile
	   * removed resample.[ch] from the makefile
	   * depend upon automake 1.4b
	   * fix in check for ccc
	     (submitted by nold via the sourceforge patch page at
	     the lame project page, patch id #103507)
	   * something I may have forgotten
	
	  Note:
	  Please don't commit any Makefile.in if you didn't have
	  changed the corresponding Makefile.am. CVS didn't stores
	  the time stamps of the files at commit time, it stores
	  the time stamps of the commit time, so we have to commit
	  the files in the correct order, but I'm to lazy to do so
	  and I assume I'm not the only one.
	  The same applies to config*.
	
	- depcomp:
	  missing file, the dependancy tracking should work again
	
2001-01-30 20:53  robert

	* libmp3lame/quantize.c:

	RH_SEEK_TABLE enables a different method of generating TOC entries
	in Xing VBR header. now enabled!
	
	PLEASE TEST TRY IT
	
	It should fix the problem poeple reported who encode radio shows or
	alike which last a few hours.
	Another advantage is, it will not steadily  increase LAME's memory footprint
	while running.

	+ replaced M_SQRT2 by SQRT2 which is defined in util.h
	+ replaced "=-" by "= -" to avoid confusion with the
	  old K&R "=-" operator, an equivalent to "-=". Even
	  though new compilers seem to handle it as an
	  assignement and unary minus sequence, but some
	  buggy compiler could be trapped here (as I).
	
2001-01-16 13:08  robert

	Raised track limit from 99 to 255 per user requests.
	
2001-01-15 08:48  gramps

	* libmp3lame/id3tag.c:

	- Simplified prologue of all public functions, removing intermediate "spec"
	  variable, and assuming (like the rest of LAME) that gfp is never null.
	- Fixed a stupid sizeof bug (mine) in "id3tag_init".
	- Raised track limit from 99 to 255 per user requests.
	- No longer write full text of genre in version 2 tag.  Now write more
	  cannonical "(num)" format where "num" is the text version of the genre
	  number, more closely following the updated ID3v2.3 spec and usage in id3lib.
	  This also makes the tag smaller.
	- Now use id3lib-compatible bogus language descriptor "XXX" in version 2
	  comment frames instead of just null bytes.
	- Changed order of frames written in version 2 tag to match version 1 tag.
	- Restored some of Frank's optimizations.
	- Fixed LAME URL.
	- Reworded some comments and fixed misspellings.
	- Moved "local_strcasecmp" back into its original position.
	- Some small reformatting to match original file.
	
2001-01-14 23:29  gramps

	* USAGE:

	- Changed "highest" to "higher" to describe recommended quality setting in
	  constant bit rate example.

	  description.

	created new routine lame_init_qval() which does all the
	gfp->quality related settings.  Cleaned up some more RH_AMP code:
	The only way to enable scalefac_scale right now is with
	-Z or --nspsytune.

	* libmp3lame/quantize.c:

2001-01-14 08:13  markt

	* testcase.mp3, libmp3lame/lame.c, libmp3lame/quantize.c:

	made a new, simpler unified amp_scalefac_bands():
	
	 *  distort[] = noise/masking
	 *  distort[] > 1   ==> noise is not masked
	 *  distort[] < 1   ==> noise is masked
	 *  max_dist = maximum value of distort[]
	 *
	 *  Three algorithms:
	 *  noise_shaping_amp
	 *        0             Amplify all bands with distort[]>1.
	 *
	 *        1             Amplify all bands with distort[] >= max_dist^(.5);
	 *                     ( 50% in the db scale)
	 *
	 *        2             Amplify first band with distort[] >= max_dist;
	 *
	 *
	 *  For algorithms 0 and 1, if max_dist < 1, then amplify all bands
	 *  with distort[] >= .95*max_dist.  This is to make sure we always
	 *  amplify at least one band.
	 *
	
	noise_shaping_amp=0        -q3 .. -q9
	noise_shaping_amp=1        -q2
	noise_shaping_amp=2        -q1, -q0
	
	--nspsytune was using what is now noise_shaping_amp=2, but the only
	way to get this now is to use --nspsytune -q1.
	Naoki: is this a problem?
	
	I also defaulted the clever RH_AMP stoping criterion in
	outer_loop.

	* libmp3lame/: lame.c, psymodel.c, quantize.c, quantize_pvt.c,

	Disabled VBR_q based lowering of ATH.  Is this still needed?
	You can always achieve the same effect with --athlower option.

2000-12-19 07:43  markt

	* frontend/: main.c, mp3rtp.c, parse.c, rtp.c, rtp.h:

	removed some size_t's.
	Added some windows code to rtp.c/mp3rtp.c:  It is supposed to
	be much improved:
	
	    LAME is really great project.
	
	    However, RTP code for multicasting isn't very good.
	
	    I've attached some modification, and tested it on Win NT4 and Win2K with
	    FreeAmp on ordinary 10 and 100 Mbit Ethernet with encoding in neverending
	    loop. It was running one week w/o any probs.
	
	    I would like to please you to not include my name anywhere (there are
	    several reason why, at the moment).
	
	However, code is very MSVC specific, so it is commented out
	with #if 0.  Most of the code was added to the end of rtp.c.
	
2000-12-19 07:00  markt

	* frontend/main.c:

	deleted stupid C++ typecasts.  LAME is written in C.

	* frontend/portableio.c:

	Portability fix from Frank, you need to define KLEMM_36 to enable it
	(no functional change if you leave it disabled):
	---snip---
	 It is a hoax to call this code portable-IO:
	
	   - It doesn't work on machines with CHAR_BIT != 8
	   - it also don't test this error condition
	   - otherwise it tries to handle CHAR_BIT != 8 by things like
	     masking 'putc(i&0xff,fp)'
	   - It doesn't handle EOF in any way
	   - it only works with ints with 32 or more bits
	   - It is a collection of initial buggy code with patching the known errors
	     instead of CORRECTING them!
	     For that see comments on the old Read16BitsHighLow()
	---snip---
	
2000-12-03 13:14  aleidinger

2000-12-01 17:42  aleidinger

	* libmp3lame/: psymodel.c, tables.c, tables.h:

	Patches from Frank:
	---snip---
	defined 4 new types for holding psydata information
	psydata  is divided into 25 normal tables (the 24 tables + 1 master table)
	access via "normal" index instead of scanning through the data
	tables are now sparsable, i.e. it is possible to remove unneeded parts
	but this is not yet done to avoid to do to much things at once
	tables are now smaller
	---snip---
	Hi also did some tests to verify this didn't changes the output.
	
	I also verified it with "make test" and some regular encoding.

2000-10-11 18:45  robert

	- lame_encode_flush, does the same as lame_encode_finish
	  but will not free lame internal buffers
	- lame_close, will free lame internal buffers
	
	So the following is equivalent to lame_encode_finish
		lame_encode_flush()
		<do some stuff like statistics>
		lame_close()
	
	But this adds the possibility to get some more
	analyzing after all frames are encoded.
	
	Suggested to use with
		lame_bitrate_hist()
		lame_stereo_mode_hist()

	for MPEG1 only
	
2000-07-31 18:38  markt

	* quantize-pvt.c, quantize-pvt.h, quantize.c, takehiro.c:

	many commits were made over the weekend.  But:
	
	1. MPEG2 encoding was broken
	2. all my test cases failed.
	
	#11 is bad.  #2 can be caused be general improvements, but
	coupled with #1 is a bad sign.
	
	I spent all of sunday tracking down the many changes, and trying
	to find what what the cause of what.  I finally ran out of time
	and am going to revert some changes back to last working copy.
	
	Here is a summary:
	
	takehiro.c:  newest version, except:
	      count_bits_long uses old code (new code commented out).
	      This code was breaking MPEG2
	
	      scfsi:  uses old slen1_n, slen2_n.  I will change this
	      with the next commit.  (in about 10min)
	
	     best_huffman_divide:  short block code breaks MPEG2.
	     short block code is still there, but disabled.
	
	quantize-pvt.c:  Newest version, except:
	
	     all noice calculations reverted back to db.
	     tot_noise, over_noise, ave_noise, etc. are given in db
	     and will always be given in db.
	
	     distort[], is left in units of energy, since this saves
	     many log10() function calls.
	
	quantize.c :  Reverted back to last working version, except
	     have newest version of VBR_iteration_loop().

	* encoder.h, lame.c:

	possible serious buffering problem fixed.  LAME buffers input data until
	it has at least 1904 samples.  It then starts processing them.
	
	The old MDCT routines processed 1728 samples and had a delay of 528.
	(introduced in 3.54) But the new MDCT routines, because the delay is
	so small (48 samples) actually need 2014 samples to be in the buffer!
	
	If you use the lame input routines, for MPEG1, this bug would
	not be found because the buffer always has well over 2014 samples
	in it.  But it was possible to trigger it in MPEG2 encodings.
	It would also be possible to trigger this bug in programs
	that use lame_enc.dll and pass LAME data that is not in
	chunks of 1152 samples.

	fixed VBR stuffing bits problem.
	if VBR uses a large frame, then ResvMax may become small, and
	we have to make sure that main_data_begin doesn't create a buffer
	which violates this condition.
	
	The old code wouldn't check the above, but it would pad the current
	frame with 0's (wasting bits) to make sure the *next* frame didn't
	violate the ResvMax condition.  But this results in wasted bits
	because in VBR there is a change the *next* frame will be at
	a lower bitrate and thus have a larger ResvMax.

	* Makefile, quantize-pvt.c, quantize-pvt.h, quantize.c:

	introduced new RH_ATH compile switch and splitted
	RH_masking into RH_SIDE_VBR, RH_SIDE_CBR and
	RH_QUALITY_CONTROL=n (n=1,2)
	
	RH_SIDE_CBR turns off side channel reduction for CBR
	RH_SIDE_VBR turns off side channel reduction for VBR
	RH_QUALITY_CONTROL=1 plus above switches equals RH_masking
	RH_QUALITY_CONTROL=2 is tuned to be used with RH_ATH
	RH_ATH changes the definition of distortion a bit:
	   a)PSY: noise over the PSY model threshold as average
	             quantization noise over PSY model threshold
		        b)ATH: max quantization noise of a single freq line over
			          the ATH threshold of that freq line
				     the resulting distortion is the min of a) and b)

	psymodel.h, quantize.c, util.c:

	MS stereo switch slightly improved:  old formula was based on the average
	of ms_ratio of both granules.  New formula uses ms_ratio from both
	granules and the previous and next granule.  This will help avoid toggleing
	MS stereo off for a single frame.  Long runs of MS stereo or regular
	stereo will not be affected.
	
	also fixed a bug in frame analyzer - it was accessing l3_xmin in the last
	scalefactor (l3_xmin and maskings are not computed for last scalefactor)
