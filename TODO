1. 
Rewrite l3bitstream/formatbitstream (the last of the ISO code)
  First form 'metaframes':    header+side_info + data
In a correct mp3 stream, some of the above data will be stored in the
previous frames (depending on main_data_begin).  When we have enough
data in the metaframes to form a complete frame, return complete
frame to calling program.  III_flushbuffer will pad with zeroes.
   

2. 
When all sfb's have energy below ATH, (analog silence)
use a 32kbs frame even if min VBR bandwidth is larger.

3.
User specified min & max bandwidth (scalefactor bands)

4.
Does stdin work when LAME is compiled to use libsndfile? 
(new version of libsndfile supports stdin - try this out)

5.
LAME uses a linear downsampling with simple lowpass filter
on the MDCT/polyphase coefficients.  Is this good enough, or
would a more expensive filter give better results?

6.
make use of subblock_gain (crude algorithm enabled with -Z) 
   One method:  loop over all possible subblock_gains and
   see which combination gives best distortion?  But this puts a lot
   of faith in the short block psycho acoustics

7.
make use of scalefactor_select  (crude algorithm enabled with -Y)

8.
10Hz high-pass filter.  Probably wont help much.


9. 
Modularization:

lame_parse_args():  main.c should parse the argument list, and then
call lame_setflags() or some other libmp3lame.a routine to 
set all the various flags.
