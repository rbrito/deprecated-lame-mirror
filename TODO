./configure scripts need work:
   library:
     ability to not compile in mpglib (decoder) probably broken
     ability to disable layer 1 and layer 2 decoding - is this really needed?
  
   frontend:  
     vbr historgram display broken


Makefile.{B32,MSVC,DJGPP} probably all broken.
these makefiles should only bother to build the static lib,
(or compile everything without even using the library)
and then make lame, mp3x and/or the dll.






1.
ACM wrapper for LAME.

Contact "Florian Bruckner" <h9651030@miraculix.wu-wien.ac.at> for info - 
he is working on the VorbisACM.

Does stdin work when LAME is compiled to use libsndfile? 
(new version of libsndfile will support this - try this out)


2. 
LAME has problems with pure DC input.  i.e. a square wave with
a frequency well below 20 Hz.  Not very important, but it should
be fixed.

Combined LPC + FFT spectral analysis will solve perhaps solve problem 2.

First the input signal is filtered with a simple low order IIR filter which
imitates the spectral sensivity of the human ear. The result is the input of
the windowed FFT. Then spectral power density is computed.

Now there are 2 possibilties:

  * The influence of the IIR is removed while computing the Spectral Power
    Density

  * The rest of the calculation is done with the preemphased SPD
    coefficients.



3. 
modify mpglib to output
floating point and have finaly quantization step a
easy-to-change module so it can output other than 16bit.

RPC support for distributed computing

Merge GOGO's fast assembler routines.

It would be nice to save some information whilst encoding
a: wave -> mp3
	a RIFF/wave can contain LIST chunks with information
	about author, title, etc. 
	==> could go into TAG fields of resulting mp3
b: mp3 -> mp3
	==> we could copy the TAG directly
c: mp3 <-> ogg
	==> copy TAG info into oggs info field and vice versa
d: mp3 -> wave
	==> copy TAG into LIST chunk
