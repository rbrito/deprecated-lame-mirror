The LAME API

This is the simple interface to the encoding part of libmp3lame.so.
The library also contains routines for adding id3 tags, Xing VBR
header, and mp3 decoding.  These routines are not fully documented,
but you can figure them out by looking at "include/lame.h" and the
example frontend encoder/decoder source code in frontend/main.c

All of these steps should be done for every MP3 to be encoded.


=========================================================================

1. (optional) Get the version number of the encoder, if you are interested.  
   void get_lame_version(char *strbuf, size_t buflen, const char *prefix);

2. Initialize the encoder.  sets default for all encoder parameters.

   #include "lame.h"
   lame_global_flags *gfp;
   gfp = lame_init();

Then override various default settings as necessary, for example:

   lame_set_num_channels(gfp,2);
   lame_set_in_samplerate(gfp,44100);
   lame_set_brate(gfp,128);
   lame_set_mode(gfp,1);
   lame_set_quality(gfp,2);   /* 2=high  5 = medium  7=low */ 
		
(Note: not all the above functions are written yet!  check in
set_get.c first).  See lame.h for the complete list of options.


3. sets more internal configuration based on data provided above,
   as well as checking for problems.  Check that ret_code >= 0.

   ret_code = lame_init_params(gfp);


4. Encode some data.  input pcm data, output (maybe) mp3 frames.
This routine handles all buffering, resampling and filtering for you.
The required mp3buffer_size can be computed from num_samples, 
samplerate and encoding rate, but here is a worst case estimate:
mp3buffer_size (in bytes) = 1.25*num_samples + 7200
The return code = number of bytes output in mp3buffer.  This can be 0.
If it is <0, an error occured.  

   int lame_encode_buffer(lame_global_flags *gfp,
         short int leftpcm[], short int rightpcm[],
         int num_samples,char *mp3buffer,int  mp3buffer_size);


There are also routines for various types of input  
(float, long, interleaved, etc).  See lame.h for details.


5. lame_encode_flush will flush the buffers and may return a 
final few mp3 frames.  mp3buffer should be at least 7200 bytes.
return code = number of bytes output to mp3buffer.  This can be 0.

int lame_encode_flush(lame_global_flags *,char *mp3buffer, int mp3buffer_size);


6.  Write all remaining data to mp3 file.  If the file was
encoded using VBR, you should add the Xing VBR header by calling:

void lame_mp3_tags_fid(lame_global_flags *,FILE* fid);


7. free the internal data structures.

void lame_close(lame_global_flags *);
